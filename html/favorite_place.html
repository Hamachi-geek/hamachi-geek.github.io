    <h1>Favorite Place</h1>
  
        <h2>Daddy O’s Music</h2>  
    <p>This is a music instruments store which loved by local music fans.<br>
        The store has so many bass guitar, guitar, equipment, and clothes of the store. Especially, so many bass guitars stimulate me. Kind shop clerk is also their good point.<br>

    <h2>Activity</h2>
    <p>This is a burger shop. Burgers are made after order, so they are always freshly made.<br>
        Thanks to well-made ingredients, burger’s patty tastes good, and it’s well baked.<br>
        Fries are also good. Picking slim French fries and shoving to my mouth is good, but my recommendation is onion fries. Its size is ideal and the batter is good. Try it!<br>
