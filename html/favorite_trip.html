    <h1>Favorite Class Trip</h1>
  
    <p>In this article, I will tell you my favorite class trip.</p>
  
    <h2>HorseBack Riding</h2>
    <p>My favorite class trip is horseback riding. I have never ridden horse and gone to ranch. When I arrived at the ranch, a white cat and dog welcomed me. </p>

    <p>After that, the owner introduced about his horses, and he told me I can ride horse. Iâ€™m not good at animal, so I was a little scared, but I encourage myself to ride it.</p>

    <p>While riding a horse, ranch staff led a horse by the rein and asked me something. For example, this study abroad, what am I studying in university and what grade am I. After I get off the horse, I was so satisfied with it.</p>
    
    <h2>Activity</h2>
    <p>After that, I did three activities, pushing a handcart, walking with two boards, and seesaw game. When pushing the cart, we organize three-person team. Two blindfolded people push the cart, and one person rode on cart to tell visual information for two people. To tell and hear information was so difficult.</p>
    <p>Next, walking with the board. About 10 people on the board held a rope and we go ahead with a signal. It was going well till halfway, but the ranch owner made hurdles. First, one person wore a blindfold. We got stacked. Second, one person turned around. We got stuck again.</p>
    <p>Last activity is seesaw game. People around the seesaw tell some information to touch a cone placed on both side of it. The seesaw was big, so it was so exciting.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The class trip was so fun and very practical.</p>
    <p>From those activities, I learned importance of challenge, teamwork, and tell information carefully yet briefly.</p>
